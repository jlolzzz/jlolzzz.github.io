This blog is brought to you by jlolzzz. 

I am a humble Systems Engineer working with cloud applications at the moment. I will be using this
site to share cool things I find along the way. Both at work and in my personal projects.
I will probably be adding some neat stuff from hobbies and other interests as well.
