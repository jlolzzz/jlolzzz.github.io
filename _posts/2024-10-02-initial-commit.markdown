#Hello Everyone!

This is my first real post here. While I still have some configurations to do. 
I wanted to get the ball rolling on the blog and maybe outline some of what is coming down the line. 
Eventually there should be some folders that highlight categories. This could range from tech and development
related topics to more fun vacation related topics. In addition I have been known to do some handy man
related projects, so it could also be some neat home improvement tips I've discovered. 

There is still some formatting and other things I will need to do for the blog in general. One of the biggest 
ones is adding a dark theme option or just making it dark themed. This may take some time as I get used to using 
Jekyll. But Iâ€™m hopping it save time using an established static blog tool over creating something myself. 
Although I have some urges to move to a JavaScript format that I am much more comfortable working with. 

Regardless of style or underlying architecture, as I get posts up. I hope that anyone who happens to pop in 
for a second can find something neat to read and checks back for more later. My goal is to try and get a post up 
at least once a month, but preferably a couple a week.
